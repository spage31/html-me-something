				<h2>Express Scripts</h2>

					<p>My very first job was at Express Scripts. I got hired on as an intern and started working in the Specialty product management department. I had almost nothing to do and basically just learned about sharepoint. I got another internship after that and then took a full-time job working as a proposal writer. It was an awful job and I only lasted about 10 months before I left.</p>

				<h2>Vivid Seats</h2>
					<img src= "images/vivid_seats.jpg" />
					<p>I decided to take a risk and moved to Chicago, IL where I began working for Vivid Seats as a bid management analyst. In this job I would basically bid on Keywords on Google and Bing and try to appear highest on the page during peak traffic. We sold a lot of tickets through this form of advertising and it was really exciting. I liked the office as it was very laid back, but I definitely didn't mesh well with my manager. I realized there was not a lot of opportunity to move up and decided to look for another job.

				<h2>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</h2>
					<img src= "images/frb_stl.jpg" />
					<p>I moved back to St. Louis and began the job I am currently in in November of 2016. In my current role I work in the information technology department. I'm an analyst, and I work on lots of different projects. I do work for the department and help support information security and the project management teams mostly. I think I am in a good spot and there is a lot of opportunity, but I'd love to get out of St. Louis. I guess time will tell, but the next career move may not be too far away...</p>
